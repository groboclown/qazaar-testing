# Reference Implementation of the Rule Engine

This directory contains the reference implementation of the Qazaar rule engine, which processes the document descriptions against the ontology and the rules.  It expects the document descriptions to have already filtered through an ontology transformation.

This reference implementation allows people who work on the schema definition to test how they work in practice.


## TODO Items

* Create the rule engine itself.
* Test.
* Add an example set of files.
