# Data Sources for Qazaar

Testers can generate many different kinds of data for constructing tests.

## Test Plans

Test plans themselves usually do not include executable tests.  However, they describe approaches for testing to attempt to cover all the features and usage scenarios.

Some places that Qazaar should look for data:

* Markdown files.
* HTML files.
* Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Write documents.
* Spreadsheets.
* Wiki pages.

Data collected should identify specific test plan names, sections, or subsections, along with applicable test taxonomy classifiers.

Each project will have its own way of building these documents, so teasing out the information requires unique methods.
