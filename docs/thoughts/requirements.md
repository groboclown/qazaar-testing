# Requirements in Qazaar

Computer project management research has, for decades, attempted to apply mathematics and scientific principles to the refinement of specifying requirements.  Most research revolves around how to turn human-written statements into a formalized specification.  While the end goal of formalized requirements allows for some great benefits, most teams cannot spend the time to put that much detail into the requirements.  Additionally, keeping these formalized requirements in-step with the actual product as bugs and change requests roll in becomes an effort in paper shuffling.

Qazaar attempts to take a middle ground approach.  Allow the requirements to have a loose set of descriptions that a computer can consume.  Then have rules to enforce conformity.

Also, Qazaar should not need all requirements fully defined.  It should allow growing the refinement of requirements along with the code and tests.
