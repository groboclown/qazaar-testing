# Qazaar Documentation

## General Discussions

* [Tag Ontology](ontology.md) describes the fundamental concepts of tagging information within sources.  Everything builds on this.


## In-Depth Ideas

* [Rule definition](rule-definition.md) describes the formal construction of the most basic elements that allow Qazaar to do its magic.  All the collected sources and extracted meta-data pump into these concepts.  Short-hands used by other documents, such as "tags", have alternative formal names.
